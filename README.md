# Health Letters

Find NYC restaurant grades near you.

This is an unfinished fever dream of a tech demo for a Ruby web app framework
inspired by Hanami and React. There's also some Javascript in there. I'd like to
keep working on this before I describe exactly what's going on, because I'm not
convinced it's a good idea yet.

Either way, you can see it in action here (but don't try the ZIP code lookup
feature because it doesn't work yet): http://health-letters.herokuapp.com
